This project is the Knight's Travails, in which I created a method that finds the shortest path on a chess board for a knight to travel from one point to another.

This was done using an implementation of the Breadth First Search algorithm, which I used to create a queue and recursively check a created Graph of Nodes.

This project required a lot of debugging, and some modifications in my overall approach since initially I ran a Depth First Search that ran either a single recursion, or infinitely.

There are a lot of things that I would like to come back and change in the future - namely the use of an instance variable to store the shortest path, but I've accomplished the goal I set out and will be continuing on to learning Test Driven Development to revisit this project at a later date.
