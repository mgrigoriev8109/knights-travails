# Knight's Travails

Knight's Travails is a program which finds the shortest path on a chess board for a knight to travel from one point to another. 

## How to play

Clone the repository locally, and run `knight.rb` to see the shortest possible path between the coordinates `[7,7]` and `[0,0]`. Alternatively open up the file and modify knight_moves to see the program work for any set of coordinates. 

## Features

- The Breadth First Search algorithm was implemented to create a queue.
- Algorithm recursively searches through a Graph of Vertices using a queue
- Created using Computer Science knowledge I acquired from previous projects, such as:
    - [Merge Sort and Recursive Fibonacci](https://github.com/mgrigoriev8109/recursion)
    - [Linked List recreation](https://github.com/mgrigoriev8109/linked_lists)
    - [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/mgrigoriev8109/binary-search-trees).

## Known Bugs

- None

## Reflections

This project required a lot of debugging, and some modifications in my overall approach since initially I ran a Depth First Search that ran either a single recursion, or infinitely.

The knight.rb and node.rb files contain the main functionality for the Knight's Travails.
